Coding in the C language, the Labyrinth Lord Thief Character Generator allows for the random generation of a level 1 Thief character. A dice rolling mechanic is created for rolling 3 six-sided dice for the Thief ability scores. Random function has also been created to represent the dice rolling mechanics for the hit points and the starting gold. Weapons, armour and equipment options are available for the Thief. Once the character has been created, and items purchased for the character, the user has the option of saving the file was an external txt file.
